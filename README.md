IN THIS APP I USE ASYNC THUNK FOR USERS AND RTK QUERY FOR ALBUMS AND PHOTOS.

ASYNC THUNK ARE SEEN AS SLIGHTLY OLDER AND MORE COMPLICATED TECHNIQUES FOR FETCHING DATA.

RTK QUERY IS SEEN AS THE NEWER AND FANCIER WAY TO FETCH DATA.

I SAW THE ASYNC THUNK FUNCTIONS:
    - I WANTED TO HAVE A WELL-ROUNDED UNDESTANDING OF REDUX TOOLKIT
    - I WANTED TO HAVE A WELL-ROUNDED UNDESTANDING OF MULTIPLE DATA-FETCHING TECHNIQUES
    - I WANTED MORE PRACTICE CREATING COMPONENTS AND CUSTOM HOOKS
